Python basics assignment 1


1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
*  - expression
'hello' - value
-87.8 - expression
-  expression
/  expression
+ expression
6 value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans : string =  group of letters, numbers or characters but not numeric values written between     “string” or ‘string’ i.e. ‘my name’
variable = is where we can assign some values as well as change it. i.e x=5, y=’hello’

3. Describe three different data types.

1. numeric = integer, float etc
2. Sequence = List, range
3.Mapping = Dictionary

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expression yields information that can be viewed by using statement

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Ans = statement is a command or action that does something i.e print(“hello world),
while expression is combination of values, operators, variables that yields something. i.e x=5

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
ans = after running code bacon =22

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
Ans : ‘spamspamspam
'spam' * 3
Ans : ‘spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans: we cant use numbers as variables, that is why 100=100 is not valid while eggs=100 is valid.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Ans:  Int(X), float(X), str(X)

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans: here + is used to concate strings but not to mathematically add values and 99 is not a string so this causes an error but we can fix it b converting 99 as a string using ‘99’ now it will work 'I have eaten ' + ‘99’ + ' burritos.'
